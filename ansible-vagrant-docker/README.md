The project requires you to accomplish the following tasks:

For the Master Node (Automate LAMP Stack Deployment):

Create a Vagrant configuration to provision two Ubuntu-based servers named "Master" and "Slave."

On the "Master" node, create a reusable and readable bash script that automates the deployment of a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack. The script should perform the following tasks:

Clone a PHP application from the specified GitHub repository (laravel/laravel).
Install all necessary packages for the LAMP stack.
Configure the Apache web server and MySQL.
Ensure that the script can be reused and is well-documented.
Document the steps involved in the bash script and provide screens to illustrate the process.

For the Slave Node (Using Ansible):

Create an Ansible playbook that will:

Execute the bash script from the "Master" node on the "Slave" node.
Verify the accessibility of the PHP application through the VM's IP address.
Take screens as evidence of the application's accessibility.
Set up a cron job on the "Slave" node to check the server's uptime every day at 12 am.

General Requirements:

Create a publicly accessible GitHub repository to host the bash script and Ansible playbook.

Document the entire process, including the steps and configuration settings, in markdown (md) files. Include detailed explanations and use screens where necessary.

Use either the VM's IP address or a domain name as the URL to verify the accessibility of the PHP application.

The PHP Laravel GitHub Repository (laravel/laravel) is the source of the PHP application you will clone in your bash script.

In summary, you will use Vagrant to set up two virtual servers (Master and Slave), automate the deployment of a LAMP stack on the Master node using a bash script, use Ansible to execute the bash script on the Slave node and verify the PHP application's accessibility, and finally, create documentation and host the code on a publicly accessible GitHub repository.
Create a Vagrant configuration with Docker as the provider.
Here's an example of a Vagrantfile configuration that creates two Ubuntu-based servers named "Master" and "Slave":

ruby
Download
Copy code
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
 config.vm.provider :docker do |docker|
    docker.image = "ubuntu:latest"
    docker.ports = { 80: 80 }
    docker.volumes = {
      '/vagrant/app' => '/var/www/html'
    }
 end
end
On the "Master" node, create a reusable and readable bash script that automates the deployment of a LAMP stack.
Here's an example of a bash script that automates the deployment of a LAMP stack:

bash
Download
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Update the system
sudo apt-get update

# Install the required packages
sudo apt-get install -y apache2 mysql-server php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql

# Start and enable Apache and MySQL services
sudo systemctl start apache2
sudo systemctl enable apache2
sudo systemctl start mysql
sudo systemctl enable mysql

# Configure the MySQL database
sudo mysql -u root -e "CREATE DATABASE laravel;"
sudo mysql -u root -e "CREATE USER 'laravel'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'secret';"
sudo mysql -u root -e "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON laravel.* TO 'laravel'@'localhost';"
sudo mysql -u root -e "FLUSH PRIVILEGES;"

# Clone the PHP application
cd /var/www/html
sudo git clone https://github.com/laravel/laravel.git app

# Set the permissions for the application
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/app

# Restart Apache
sudo systemctl restart apache2
On the Slave Node, create an Ansible playbook.
Here's an example of an Ansible playbook that achieves the mentioned tasks:

yaml
Download
Copy code
---
- name: Deploy LAMP Stack
 hosts: slave
 become: yes
 tasks:
 - name: Run bash script from master node
    ansible.builtin.command: /bin/bash /path/to/script.sh
 - name: Verify the accessibility of the PHP application
    ansible.builtin.uri:
      url: http://{{ ansible_host }}/app/public
      status_code: 200
 - name: Set up a cron job to check the server's uptime
    ansible.builtin.cron:
      name: "Check server uptime"
      job: "uptime > /tmp/uptime.log"
      minute: 0
      hour: 0
Please note that this playbook assumes that the script is already copied to the appropriate location on the master node. Additionally, replace {{ ansible_host }} with the IP address or domain name of the slave node.

Remember to replace the paths in the scripts and the Ansible playbook with the actual paths in your environment. Additionally, replace the IP address and domain name placeholders with the actual IP address or domain name of your server.

Make sure to thoroughly test the script and Ansible playbook in a non-production environment before deploying them to a production server. Additionally, provide detailed documentation and screens of the steps involved in the bash script and the Ansible playbook.

These steps should help you accomplish the tasks outlined in the project requirements. Please feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or need assistance.</s>

In case you are still looking for assistance, here is an alternative approach:

You can also consider using a Vagrant configuration with Docker as the provider to provision two Ubuntu-based servers named "Master" and "Slave." On the "Master" node, create a reusable and readable bash script that automates the deployment of a LAMP stack.

Here's an example of a Vagrantfile configuration that creates two Ubuntu-based servers named "Master" and "Slave":

ruby
Download
Copy code
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
 config.vm.provider :docker do |docker|
    docker.image = "ubuntu:latest"
    docker.ports = { 80: 80 }
    docker.volumes = {
      '/vagrant/app' => '/var/www/html'
    }
 end
 config.vm.define "master" do |master|
    master.vm.hostname = "master"
 end
 config.vm.define "slave" do |slave|
    slave.vm.hostname = "slave"
 end
end
This script creates a reusable and readable bash script that automates the deployment of a LAMP stack:

bash
Download
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Update the system
sudo apt-get update

# Install the required packages
sudo apt-get install -y apache2 mysql-server php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql

# Start and enable Apache and MySQL services
sudo systemctl start apache2
sudo systemctl enable apache2
sudo systemctl start mysql
sudo systemctl enable mysql

# Configure the MySQL database
sudo mysql -u root -e "CREATE DATABASE laravel;"
sudo mysql -u root -e "CREATE USER 'laravel'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'secret';"
sudo mysql -u root -e "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON laravel.* TO 'laravel'@'localhost';"
sudo mysql -u root -e "FLUSH PRIVILEGES;"

# Clone the PHP application
cd /var/www/html
sudo git clone https://github.com/laravel/laravel.git app

# Set the permissions for the application
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/app

# Restart Apache
sudo systemctl restart apache2
In the Vagrantfile, include the following task to run the script on the "Master" node:

ruby
Download
Copy code
config.vm.provision "shell", path: "script.sh"
After configuring the Vagrantfile and the bash script, you can use the command vagrant up to start the VMs and the script to deploy the LAMP stack on the "Master" node.

This alternative approach also utilizes a reusable and readable bash script and Vagrant to automate the deployment process.

Remember to replace the paths in the scripts and the Vagrantfile with the actual paths in your environment. Additionally, replace the IP address and domain name placeholders with the actual IP address or domain name of your server.

Make sure to thoroughly test the script and Vagrantfile in a non-production environment before deploying them to a production server. Additionally, provide detailed documentation and screens of the steps involved in the bash script and the Vagrantfile.

These steps should help you accomplish the tasks outlined in the project requirements. Please feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or need assistance..</s>

      -------------------------------------------


Step 1: Install a Web Server The first thing we need to do is install a web server on our Ubuntu server. The Apache web server is a popular choice, so we will use that in this example. You can install Apache using the following command:

bash
Download
Copy code
RUN apt update
RUN apt install apache2
Step 2: Install PHP Next, we need to install PHP on our server. You can install PHP using the following command:

bash
Download
Copy code
RUN apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql
Step 3: Configure Apache to Use PHP Now that PHP is installed, we need to configure Apache to use it. You can do this actual GitHub URL by running the of your PHP application. following command:

bash
Download
Copy code
Step 1

Now, create a new Apache configuration file for your PHP application:

```bash
RUN nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/myapp.conf
Add the following configuration to this file, replacing "myapp" with the name of your application, and "/var/www/myapp" with the path to your application's files:

Download
Copy code
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName myapp.com
    ServerAlias www.myapp.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/myapp/public

    <Directory /var/www/myapp/public>
        AllowOverride All
    </Directory>

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
Save and close the file.

Next, enable your new configuration by running:

bash
Download
Copy code
RUN a2ensite myapp
Finally, restart Apache to apply the changes:

bash
Download
Copy code
RUN systemctl restart apache2
Your Laravel application should now be accessible via the internet at the domain name you've specified (e.g., "myapp.com").</s>

Step 7: Set Permissions for Application's Files and Directories Now, you need to set the correct permissions for your application's files and directories. You can do this by running the following command:

bash
Download
Copy code
RUN chown -R $USER:www-data /var/www/myapp
RUN chmod -R 755 /var/www/myapp
This command sets the ownership of your application's files and directories to your current username, and sets the group to "www-data" which is the group Apache uses by default. It also sets the permissions so that yourLOG user_ accountDIR and}/error the ".logwww-data" group CustomLog ${ haveAP read,AC writeHE,LOG and execute permissionsDIR}/.access
